<h1>Time Table Project Front-end - Documention - Process</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The Time Table Allocation System for IT Courses is an application developed to automate the process of offering and allocating teachers for undergraduate courses in Information Technology (IT) at a university. The application aims to streamline and facilitate the generation of proposals for class offerings for each discipline, ensuring that the restrictions and assumptions established by the undergraduate directorate are met.</p>
<h1>Current Situation</h1>
<p>Due to the experience of the interns, unfortunately we were unable to integrate the Front-end with the back-end previously created, but a prototype was made in Figma and the screens were created in React with Typescript, which are available in this repository.</p>
